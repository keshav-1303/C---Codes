/*
Modular Arithmetic Sometimes, the answer to a problem is a very large number, but it is enough to output it “modulo m”, i.e., the remainder when the answer is divided by m (e.g., “modulo 1e9 + 7”). The idea is that even if the actual answer is very large, it suffices to use the types int and long long.

An important property of remainders is that the following formulas hold:
(a + b) mod m = (a mod m + b mod m) mod m
(a − b) mod m = (a mod m − b mod m) mod m
(a * b) mod m = (a mod m * b mod m) mod m

Thus, we can take the remainder after every operation, and the numbers will never
become too large
