// You are given a string s such that each its character is either 1, 2, or 3. You have to choose the shortest contiguous substring of s such that it contains each of these three characters at least once.

// A contiguous substring of string s is a string that can be obtained from s by removing some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of s and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of s
